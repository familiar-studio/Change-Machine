         <h1>5 Ways To Protect Yourself Against Identity Theft</h1>
        </div>When your information is stolen, it can be sold or used to obtain money, credit or even expensive medical procedures. If you are not careful in protecting and securing your records, you’ll have to work even harder to repair the damage that can be caused to your credit. There are several things you can do right now to minimize the risk of identity theft and give you peace of mind.<br><ol><li><strong>Guard Your Digits</strong> Be very careful about whom you give your Social Security number to. There are only a few reasons to share it, like with your employer, tax preparer, your bank or to access your credit report. Private businesses—including credit card companies—shouldn’t need it. Offer them the last four digits instead. Better yet, have them use an alternate way to identify you, like your driver’s license number. Also, when you pay your bills, don’t write your entire account number on the memo line, just use the last set of digits.</li><li><strong>Get Your Free Credit Report</strong> Checking your credit report regularly for unauthorized accounts is the best way to make sure no one is pretending to be you. Access your free credit reports from <a href="http://annualcreditreport.com">annualcreditreport.com</a> or 1-877-322-8228 and make sure all the accounts are yours.</li><li><strong>Keep Financial Information Out Of Sight</strong> While we may worry about strangers lurking on the Internet, identity theft is more likely to happen by someone you know, like relatives, roommates or ex- spouses. Keep passwords, checkbooks, and account numbers in a safe place. Take extra precaution by changing your password regularly, blacking out account numbers, and using a shredder before you throw things away.</li><li><strong>Stop Credit Card Offers </strong>“Soft” credit report inquiries—when credit card companies check your report to send you an offer—can cause identity theft. Thieves pretend to have a legitimate business reason to check your report, but what they really want is your personal and financial information. Contact optoutprescreen.com or 1-888-5OPT-OUT to stop this type of inquiry, and reduce the chance for identity theft.</li><li><strong>Take Precautions</strong> If your wallet is lost or stolen, or if your personal information has been compromised in any other way, consider placing a fraud alert with the three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion). A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name. Potential creditors will use more difficult procedures to protect your identity, like asking for information about your billing zip code, or the current telephone number you have on file. You can place an initial alert, which stays in your file for 90 days, or an extended alert, which stays in your file for seven years, by calling, or writing one of the three credit reporting bureaus.</li></ol>
