<p>Ask <strong>open-ended questions</strong> to help customers explore  potential spending trade-offs. “How would you prioritize your expenses?”  or “What’s most important to you?” Avoid judgmental questions that can  lead the customer to become defensive, such as “Why do you spend so much  at the salon?” or “Why don’t you quit smoking?” Help customers take a  step back and look carefully at all their expenses to examine if their  decisions are aligned with their financial goals.</p>
<div class="task">
<h4>DEVELOP CREATIVE SOLUTIONS</h4>
<p>Explore cost-saving opportunities, such as buying a monthly transit  card instead of a weekly one, buying certain groceries in bulk,  discontinuing portions of a combined cable or phone package, and  enrolling in special programs (see <a href="http://financialcoachtoolkit.com/milestones/detail/customer-maximizes-cash-flow" target="_blank">ACTION: CUSTOMER MAXIMIZES INCOME SUPPORTS</a>).  Customers can also take control of expenses by calling creditors and  billing companies to change due dates to dates that work best for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>CLARIFY NECESSARY INCOME STREAM</h4>
<p>Helping customers decide on their “must-have”  expenses allows them to recalculate their “must-have” income target.  This calculation can provide a lot of clarity for customers as they  review their expenses and take ownership of their spending plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>EXPLORE YEAR-ROUND TAX PLANNING</h4>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://financialcoachtoolkit.com/roadmap/taxes" target="_blank">TAXES MAP</a> (see <a href="http://financialcoachtoolkit.com/milestones/detail/customer-maximizes-tax-credits-and-deductions-to-achieve-goals" target="_blank">ACTION: CUSTOMER TAKES ADVANTAGE OF TAX INCENTIVES AND CREDITS</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>DISCUSS THE REFUND EARLY</h4>
<p>Explore ways of maximizing tax benefits. For some customers, the tax  refund can be the largest source of income received all year. Start your  discussion early about how refunds can close deficits and ultimately  support financial goals. Refer to the 7 HEALTHY THINGS TO DO WITH YOUR  REFUND WorkSheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>ADJUST WITHHOLDING ALLOWANCES</h4>
<p>Payroll departments use W-4 forms to calculate how much tax to withhold  from each paycheck. They can be modified at any time, and for  low-income families in particular, a change on this form can be a  low-risk and high-impact strategy to improve cash flow. Online  calculators (like <a href="http://paycheckcity.com/calculators.htm" target="_blank">paycheckcity.com/calculators.htm</a>)  can help map out different scenarios. If customers end up not paying  enough taxes over the year through withholding, they may end up owing  money at tax time. But never encourage customers to use inaccurate  information on the W-4.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>EXAMINE DEBT LOAD</h4>
<p>Low-cost credit is a potential tool for an infrequent, short-term  financial problem, but must be considered very carefully. Relying on  credit is not a sustainable long-term strategy, since debts can quickly  grow to the point that even the minimum balance payments become  unaffordable. Review the <a href="http://financialcoachtoolkit.com/roadmap/debt" target="_blank">DEBT MAP</a> for debt management strategies.</p>

                                <strong>Caution</strong>
                                  <p>If customers have done everything they can to pare down expenses, ask  about other possibilities to increase income, such as investing in  higher education or vocational training programs, exploring career path  changes, or entrepreneurial opportunities. You can make a referral to a  workforce development or small business development center. You can also  revisit the ENVISIONING MY GOAL WorkSheet to ground the conversation.  For some families, challenging financial times may open the door to  relocating where they can access stronger support networks or better  income-generating opportunities.

The first  step is to get a concrete picture of how much money is going in and out  of the household. <br><br><div class="task">
<h4>WRITE IT DOWN</h4>
<p>The MONTHLY INCOME AND EXPENSES WorkSheet is a  great place to start. For some expenses, customers may need to refer  back to recent bills or start a daily or a weekly spending journal. The  DAILY EXPENSES WorkSheet is an easy journaling tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>DO THE MATH</h4>
<p>Even the smallest expenses can add up. Tracking  these expenses, even for a few days, can help customers make more  informed spending decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>DISCUSS DEBT LATER</h4>
<p>Debt servicing should not be addressed just yet.  First, get the customer’s regular monthly expenses down on paper leaving  out money to pay down debt. Understanding the customer’s basic expenses  will lead to more productive discussions about effective debt-reduction  strategies down the road.</p>

<p>Government-sponsored public benefits (Food Stamps, etc.) are vital  programs, but are by no means the only option. Non governmental and  privately-funded programs can range from discounted utility rates and  hot meals to discounted phone service and summer youth programs. For  example, see <a href="http://lifeline.gov" target="_blank">lifeline.gov</a>, which provides information about discounted telephone service for low-income people, and <a href="http://dwss.nv.gov" target="_blank">dwss.nv.gov</a>,  which describes Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program. Some customer  groups can often have multiple options (senior citizens, domestic  violence survivors, families in need of “bridge” loans or grants for  one-time emergencies).</p>
<div class="task">
<h4>BUILD PARTNERSHIPS</h4>
<p>Develop relationships in the community and an understanding of  eligibility requirements to strengthen direct referral networks whenever  possible. Local partners that offer benefit screenings and facilitated  enrollment for multiple programs at a single location can be especially  helpful. For example, Single Stop USA (<a href="http://singlestop.org" target="_blank">singlestop.org</a>),  which has sites in California, Florida, New Jersey, and New Mexico,  provides low-income people with a broad range of services at a single  location.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>COMPILE RESOURCES</h4>
<p>Research local and online resources and be prepared with handy <strong>print-outs </strong>that  guide customers to specific programs and organizations. Programs  increasingly offer online access to eligibility requirements,  application guidelines, and “frequently asked questions.&quot;Some resources  for Food Stamp and Social Security programs for example, are available  here: </p>

<div class="task">
<h4>MAP CHANGES IN CASH FLOW</h4>
<p>Work through the different scenarios with  customers, helping them see the impact that enrolling would have on  their savings and debt several months down the line.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>OFFER SUPPORT THROUGH THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS</h4>
<p>The enrollment process can often be long and  sometimes frustrating. Serving as an accountability partner can be the  final push needed to help customers’ secure critical benefits that can  move them to the position to implement a steady savings strategy.</p>

                                <strong>Caution</strong>
                                  <p>Help customers move past stigmas or concerns about public benefits.  Sometimes customers are resistant to seek assistance. Probe further and  determine the root of their reluctance. Remind customers that they are  legally eligible for these benefits because they have paid into the  system. For questions around eligibility requirements around  immigration, tax and other enrollment implications, referrals to  community partners and experts in the respective fields might be your  best option.

<p>An employee benefits package can be overwhelming. Help customers to  take the first step by having them bring in their package to <strong>review together</strong>.  Ask about everything from matched savings and legal services, to  scholarships and tuition reimbursement for employees and their families.  Encourage customers to connect with local union representatives and/or  Human Resources Department to get a full explanation of all benefit  possibilities.</p>
<div class="task">
<h4>REVIEW THE BENEFITS OF PRE-TAX PROGRAMS</h4>
<p>Participating in employee programs may not only help customers save for  retirement, but often can result in significant tax savings in the  immediate tax year. Because of the tax advantages, well-planned  contributions may have minimal impact on customers’ take-home pay. Be  sure to check out the PRE-TAX DOLLARS: MONEY BACK IN YOUR POCKET  TipSheet and incorporate transportation benefits, flexible health  spending plans, and employer-matched 401(k)s and 403(b)s into the  MONTHLY INCOME AND EXPENSES WorkSheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>CALCULATE THE &quot;FREE MONEY&quot; THAT MAY BE LEFT BEHIND</h4>
<p>Help customers understand <strong>employer-matched retirement programs</strong>.  Do the math together and show customers the amount of money they may be  leaving money on the table. Even if 401(k) and 403(b) contributions are  not matched by an employer, customers who are not refunded all of their  income taxes at the end of the year should consider the potentially  “effortless” impact of making even small monthly contributions.</p>

                                  <p>Some customers may view their retirement plan as an emergency savings  account. Unless they are in an extremely unique situation, customers  should not consider withdrawing money from their retirement accounts as a  last resort to pay down debts. Review the penalties for early  withdrawal and the missed opportunities for compounding so customers  understand the dangers of tapping into their retirement savings.

Customers should explore  creative options to reduce costs, keeping in mind that quality child  care is of paramount importance.</p>
<div class="task">
<h4>KNOW YOUR LOCAL AND STATE PROGRAMS</h4>
<p>In addition to considering relatives and other support networks,  low-cost day care centers and after-school programs might also be  available. Customers receiving public assistance or exiting such  programs may be eligible for child care benefits, and in certain states,  four-year-olds are also able to attend Universal Pre-K programs. For  example, Care 4 Kids (<a href="http://ctcare4kids.com" target="_blank">ctcare4kids.com</a>) is a resource to assist certain low-income Connecticut families obtain funding to make quality child care affordable.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>CALCULATE THE COST OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS</h4>
<p>Help customers plan ahead and map out the financial  impact of each child care option. The cost of transportation, extra  fees for the occasions customers have to work late, and even the effect  on customers’ psychological and emotional well-being, are all extremely  important factors to consider and integrate into the design of a viable  monthly spending plan.
