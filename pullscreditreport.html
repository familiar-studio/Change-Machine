Customers are entitled to review all three reports one time each year for free.

<p class="p1"><b>KNOW HOW TO PULL THE CREDIT REPORT ONLINE</b></p>
<p class="p1">It may seem complicated, but if you follow these instructions carefully, you’ll be able to help customers obtain their reports. Try and get customers to do as much of the inputting as possible as you request the reports, so that they’ll also be able to do it without you next time.</p>
<ol class="ol1"><li class="li1">Go to annualcreditreport.com. Be careful to go to this site only and not any of the other sites with similar names that offer “free” credit reports. These sites will ask for a credit card number and are not truly free.</li><li class="li1">Select the state where the customer resides and click on REQUEST REPORT.</li><li class="li1">Enter in all the requested information. For the customer’s “current address,” use the current address unless there was a very recent move, in which case the last address should be used. If the customer has lived at the current address for less than two years, also include the previous address. At the bottom of the page, enter in the alphanumerical code (it’s not case sensitive) and click on CONTINUE.</li><li class="li1">Select the credit report(s) you want to access (Experian, Equifax, and Transunion), then click on NEXT.</li><li class="li1">5 The site will confirm which report(s) you’ve selected and alert you that you’ll be transferred to that site. Click NEXT.</li><li class="li1">Depending on which credit report you’re downloading, the next screen might ask you to confirm that all the data you entered in previously is accurate. Assuming it is, click CONTINUE. If not, make the changes necessary and then click CONTINUE.</li><li class="li1">The next screen will have a series of questions about the customer (some of which may seem a little strange) to verify identity. An example of a common question is “Your credit file indicates you may have a mortgage account opened in or around 2008. Who is the credit provider for this account?” The customer should not be afraid to select “None of the above” if that response applies. As with any multiple- choice question, if you’re not certain what the answer is, guess. Once all the questions are answered, click CONTINUE.</li><li class="li1">The next screen should confirm that a credit report is being ordered and that the cost is $0.00. Click on SUBMIT ORDER.</li><li class="li1">The next screen varies from report to report, but you want to select the option for VIEW/PRINT report. Don’t be tempted by any of the services that cost money, such as purchasing a credit score. There are other cost-free ways to obtain credit scores discussed below.</li><li class="li1">The next screen typically provides you with a summary of the report. That summary may be helpful and you should definitely print it out, but that is not the full report. To get the full report, click on the link for PRINT REPORT. Congratulations! If you assisted your customer with this process, hopefully your customers can do it totally unassisted next time.</li></ol>
<p class="p1"><b>HELP CUSTOMERS STAY ORGANIZED</b></p>
<p class="p1">For record-keeping and document- preservation purposes, it may be helpful to create a PDF of the credit report by printing it with a program, such as doPDF, which you can access at dopdf.com and download for free. If your customer opts not to create a PDF file, be sure to print out at least two copies of the report, as you’ll want one to review and take notes on and another to use for the dispute process. Customers should use the MAKE YOUR CREDIT REPORT WORK FOR YOU WorkSheet to keep track of when they pulled each report, their credit scores, and what to look for on the report.</p>

<p class="p2">Before customers embark on a mission to improve their credit, it is very important for coaches to help customers connect how improving credit is integral to their goals. Many customers want to improve their credit score just for the sake of improving it, and get overly focused on the number without thinking about why improving their score is important. Getting obsessed about one’s score is often not conducive to long-term credit health or financial security. </p>

Some of the instances of which The Financial Clinic is aware occurred when undocumented individuals with mainstream bank accounts were offered credit cards by their banks.  A bank account is likely a necessity to building credit, since the bank may offer you a credit card that they can secure (establish collateral against) using your checking or savings account.  The bank may offer you credit if they believe they can seize your bank account if you refuse to pay your credit card bills.  In order to open a mainstream bank account, you will need to have an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), which is obtained when an undocumented individual files a U.S. federal income tax return.  If you have been able to access a secured or unsecured credit card under your ITIN, you should monitor your credit report.  However, Experian is the only credit reporting agency that shares credit files with undocumented individuals who have built a credit record.  To view the credit report of an undocumented individual who has established credit, visit annualcreditreport.com and click the hyperlink entitled &quot;request your report through the mail.&quot;  In place of a Social Security Number, enter the 9-digit ITIN and fill in the bubble to indicate that you are requesting the Experian report.  Pull this report once a year.
