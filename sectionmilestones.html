<div class="task">
<h4>GET ALREADY PAID FEDERAL TAX LIENS WITHDRAWN</h4>
<p>Once a tax lien is paid, the IRS will withdraw the lien if the taxypayer requests it. See <a href="http://irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=236540,00.html" target="_blank">irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=236540,00.html</a> for  more details. The prior rule was that even after the lien was paid it  would still stay on a customer&#39;s credit report for seven years, dragging  down a customer&#39;s score. Customers should file <strong>Form 12277</strong> (Google it or go to <a href="http://irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f12277.pdf" target="_blank">irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f12277.pdf</a>)  to request lien withdrawal. In Item 11 on the form, customers should  check the box for &quot;The taxpayer, or the Taxpayer Advocate acting on  behalf of the taxpayer, believes withdrawal is in the best interest of  the taxpayer and the government.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>USE CREDIT REPORT DISPUTES TO MAKE PAID FEDERAL TAX LIENS DISAPPEAR</h4>
<p>The only way to get a tax lien off a credit report is to have it  withdrawn. Then send the CRAs dispute letters with documentation of the  withdrawal attached (see <a href="http://financialcoachtoolkit.com/roadmap/credit" target="_blank">CREDIT MAP</a>  for more details) and the lien goes away. The IRS may not report to the  CRAs that the lien has been withdrawn. The burden is on customers to  let the CRAs know. </p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>CAUSE UNPAID FEDERAL TAX LIENS TO DISAPPEAR</h4>
<p>The IRS will also remove a lien if a taxpayer enters into a <strong>direct debit installment agreement</strong>  (DDIA) to pay a tax lien. That means the IRS will withdraw the lien  even before it has been paid. According to the IRS the lien &quot;will be  withdrawn after a probationary period demonstrating that direct debit  payments will be honored.&quot; Customers can contact the IRS at  1-800-829-1040 to begin the DDIA enrollment process.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>WHY IT MATTERS</h4>
<p>These new lien procedures are more important because tax liens can  cause significant credit score damage, as much as a 100-point drop. WIth  federal tax liens, the key is to ask whether the lien has been paid. If  it has, ask the IRS to withdraw the lien. To address unpaid tax liens,  customers should enroll in DDIA with the IRS to begin paying off the  lien, get the lien withdrawn, and off customers&#39; credit reports. </p>
</div>
<h4>DEALING WITH STATE TAX LIENS</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, these new IRS procedures <strong>do not </strong>apply  to state tax liens. If a customer has paid a state tax lien, the  customer should contact the state tax authority and request lien  withdrawal. If the lien is unpaid, the customer should explore repayment  options with the state tax authority, and, once repayment options are  arranged, inquire about lien withdrawal. Request that the state tax  authority follow the favorable IRS protocols.</p>

Most types of  income (wages, interest, dividends and self-employment income) must be  reported and are taxed by both the federal and state agencies. It does  not matter whether customers are citizens or undocumented, whether they  live alone or are the dependent of someone else, their income may be  taxed (see the <strong>People in the household</strong> and <strong>Money coming in</strong>  boxes on the FORM &quot;1040&quot; TAX PUZZLE WorkSheet). You can reassure  customers that taxes are not as complicated or intimidating as they may  expect. </p>
<div class="task">
<h4>ALMOST EVERYONE NEEDS TO FILE TAXES</h4>
<p>A taxpayer is not required to file if she or he makes less than a certain amount. Check out the table below:</p>
<p><em>For tax year 2011, customers with income above the following amounts must file a tax return:</em><br>Single: $9,500<br>Married filing jointly (MFJ): $19,000<br>Married filing separately (MFS): $3,700<br>Head of household (HOH): $12,200</p>
</div>
<h4>EMPHASIZE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD CONSIDER FILING</h4>
<p>Encourage all your customers to prepare their taxes and make this an  annual habit. Many of the individuals you will work with are eligible  for refunds, since taxes have been withheld from their paychecks  throughout the year. There are also tax credits specifically intended  for low-income taxpayers and students. Many customers will never know if  they&#39;re entitled to a refund unless they take the time to have their  taxes prepared. Tax laws and customers&#39; lives change frequently, so a  customer can easily become eligible (or ineligible) for a refund without  even realizing it.</p>

The paid tax industry spends over $ one billion in advertising dollars to get customers to use their services. This doesn&#39;t mean all paid preparers are bad news, but be sure customers fully understand their options before filing. <p><br></p><h4>FILE FOR FREE</h4>

<p>Many customers may be eligible to have their taxes prepared for free at a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) site. Customers should review REASONS TO GO TO A FREE TAX PREPARATION SITE TipSheet</p>
<h4>EXPLORE LOW-COST OPTIONS</h4>

<p>If customers earn too much money to qualify for VITA sites, they should still consider using other community or e-file services, which have higher income caps. Using these services is preferable to dropping several hundred dollars by going to a paid preparer. Read more about free e-file services at <a href="http://irs.gov/efile" target="_blank">irs.gov/efile</a>.</p>
<h4>CONSIDER SELF-PREP</h4>

<p>There are many do-it-yourself options and for customers with basic returns, this is a good alternative to spending the fees on filing. Check out <a href="http://beehive.org" target="_blank">beehive.org</a> or TurboTax for other online options.</p><p></p>

                                  <p>Undocumented customers can and should consider filing tax returns. They  often will owe money because they do not have taxes withheld throughout  the year. The IRS and federal immigration authorities do not share  information with each other except in rare circumstances. See 26 U.S.C.  §6103 for details. Filing tax returns regularly may eventually be  considered a positive factor for citizenship. Undocumented customers  whill need to apply for an Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN)  using Form W-7 to be able to file. you can find the form at <a href="http://irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw7.pdf" target="_blank">irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw7.pdf</a>.  Due to recent changes in some states&#39; laws, undocumented customers  should consult with an immigration attorney before filing a state tax  return.

                          <div class="actionDetails" id="detailsa07J0000003g2DhIAI" style="">Explain to customers that while tax returns are filed around April 15,  planning, organizing, and strategizing is a year-long process. Educate  customers about organizing and maintaining accurate records, planning  both income and expenses, and ensuring accuracy of withholding  information and deductions. An accurate tax return depends on a lot  of information. It’s critical that you help the customer develop a  system for recordkeeping.<br><h4>GET ORGANIZED</h4>

<div class="task">
<h4>CREATE A FOLDER</h4>
<p>Help customers create a filing system for the current year so that as  soon as tax papers come in, they have a place to put them. Paper clips  and post-in notes can go a long way.</p>

<ul><li>Earnings in the form of <strong>wages</strong>, <strong>salaries</strong>, <strong>tips</strong>,  and any income reported on W-2 and 1099-MISC forms must be reported on a  1040. Filing a tax return allows an individual to reclaim any federal  income tax that was withheld from paychecks, estimated  tax payments,  and prior year overpayments.</li><li><strong>Self-employed</strong> customers or those who work as  independent contractors, freelancers, or earn cash need to !le Schedule  C. In addition to business income, they may be able to deduct business  expenses and losses as well. The SELF-EMPLOYED? TRACK YOUR   INCOME WorkSheet is very useful for customers who need to track their  business income and expenses. Many people who informally earn money  selling things or doing odd jobs may not think they have a business  and business income, but they do. And that extra business income can  help someone qualify for a larger tax refund in some cases. Cash earners  should review PAID IN CASH? WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT YOUR  TAXES TipSheet.</li><li>Under federal law, <strong>unemployment compensation</strong> is  taxable. Some people elect to have taxes withheld from their  unemployment benefits and others don’t. Those who don’t elect for  withholding will have to pay taxes on the benefits they  received. Unemployment compensation is reported on a 1099-G.</li><li>Check out the 1040 for <strong>other income </strong>that needs to be  reported on the tax return such as gambling winnings, alimony,  retirement or pension distributions, social security benefits, etc. </li></ul>

<h4>GET BANKING IN PLACE</h4>
<p>Using direct deposit can be a good alternative to get refund dollars  fast. For customers that are accustomed to getting Refund  Anticipation Loans (RALs), review the 5 FRINGE SERVICES TO  AVOID TipSheet and explain the absurdly high fees and finance charges on  these loans. Remind customers that by direct depositing their refund  into a checking or savings account, the federal refund will be arrive  within 8-10 business days (state refunds often take longer). The earlier  in the tax season customers file, the faster they’ll get their refunds.  Get customers set up before tax season using the 6 EASY STEPS TO OPEN A  BANK ACCOUNT TipSheet. Confirm routing and account numbers of  customers’ bank account where they would like to have the refund  deposited. Make sure the customer walks into the tax site with a  canceled check or deposit slip for their account(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>REVIEW PREVIOUS RETURNS</h4>
<p>Ask customers to bring in documents and tax returns from the previous  three years. If customers do not have past tax transcrips, help request  them by calling IRS at <strong>1-800-829-1040</strong> and your state&#39;s general hotline. Your state may charge a few cents per page to copy the return.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>SCREEN FOR TAX ISSUES</h4>
<p>Examine IRS and your state tax department notices and communications.  These should be a separate folder for any tax year that you are  discussing with customers. Don&#39;t forget to remind them to keep the  folders in a safe place (it is full of confidential information).</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>IDENTIFY RED FLAGS</h4>
<p>Ask customers if they have ever expected a refund and did not receive  it or the refund came back less than what was expected.  Assess customers’ past year return to see if all appropriate tax credits  or possible deductions were claimed.</p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<h4>DETERMINE APPROPRIATE STATES</h4>
<p>Remember that customers who live and/or work in two different states  may have to file returns in both states. Also, many states have  companion tax credits to the federal ones.</p>
